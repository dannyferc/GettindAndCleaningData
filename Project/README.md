#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

##Introduction

This repository includes the 4 files:

- README.md
- CodeBook.md: file that describes the data, and any transformations or work performed
- run_analysis.R: file that includes the code needed to achieve the project desired results
- tiny.txt: file with the data generated after executing the run_analysis.R

##Execution

1. Unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2. Run_analysis.R script and the UCI HAR Dataset folder must be in the same directory
3. Edit the setwd line of the run_analysis.R script and add your own working directory
4. Execute the script using source("run_analysis.R")
5. Check the tidy.txt file created with the desired data in your working directory
