- tiny.txt: file with the data generated after executing the run_analysis.R

##Execution

1. Unzip the file getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip
2. **Run_analysis.R** script and the **UCI HAR Dataset** folder must be in the same directory
3. Edit the setwd line of the run_analysis.R script and add your own working directory
4. Using RStudio, execute the script writting the command: **source("run_analysis.R")**
5. Check the **tidy.txt** file created with the desired data in your working directory
